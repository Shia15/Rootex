Thanks for your interest in improving Rootex!  
Here are some quick guidelines:

## 🧱 Design + Frontend

- Structure components clearly
- Keep the glass + gradient aesthetic

## 🌀 Animations

- Favor Tailwind transitions or Smart Animate if ported from Figma
- Keep animations subtle and purposeful

## 🔧 Git

- Use clear commit messages
- PRs should target `main` with descriptive titles
